# Temporal Knowledge Graph Integration in Open Deep Search Agents: A Comprehensive Quantitative Evaluation

## Abstract

This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of integrating Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKG) into the Open Deep Search (ODS) agent framework for SEC filing analysis. We developed a hybrid dataset combining synthetic temporal events with real-world SEC filing data from the EDGAR database to evaluate three distinct approaches: baseline web search, GraphRAG with Neo4j, and advanced Temporal Knowledge Graphs using Zep's Graphiti engine. Our evaluation demonstrates significant quantitative improvements, with TKG achieving 770% improvement in temporal intelligence, 9× faster response times, and 100% success rate compared to baseline approaches. The results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of temporal knowledge graph integration for time-sensitive financial analysis applications.

## I. Introduction

Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have revolutionized information access and reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. However, these systems often struggle with temporal knowledge that evolves over time, particularly in enterprise environments where historical context and temporal relationships are critical for accurate analysis. Traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods focus primarily on static document retrieval without considering temporal dynamics, fact evolution, or time-sensitive relationships between entities.

This limitation becomes particularly pronounced in financial document analysis, where understanding temporal patterns, regulatory compliance timelines, and historical filing behaviors is essential for accurate assessment. SEC filing analysis requires sophisticated temporal reasoning to identify irregular patterns, detect compliance anomalies, and understand the evolution of corporate reporting behaviors over time.

Our research addresses these limitations by integrating temporal knowledge graphs into the Open Deep Search (ODS) agent framework, enabling time-aware memory and sophisticated temporal reasoning capabilities. The key contributions of this work include:

1. **Novel TKG Integration Architecture**: First implementation of Zep's Graphiti engine within an open agent framework for temporal reasoning
2. **Hybrid Dataset Development**: Creation of a comprehensive dataset combining synthetic temporal events with real SEC filing data
3. **Comprehensive Quantitative Evaluation**: Systematic comparison across three distinct approaches with rigorous performance metrics
4. **Temporal Query Recognition System**: Development of intelligent prompt-based TKG invocation mechanisms
5. **Performance Validation**: Demonstration of 770% improvement in temporal intelligence with enterprise-scale applicability

## II. Literature Review

### A. Temporal Knowledge Graphs: Foundations and Evolution

Temporal Knowledge Graphs represent a significant evolution from traditional static knowledge graphs by incorporating time-based relationships and fact validity periods. Trivedi et al. [1] introduced the concept of temporal fact representation with (subject, predicate, object, timestamp) quadruples, enabling time-aware reasoning capabilities. Recent advances by Lacroix et al. [2] demonstrated that temporal embeddings significantly outperform static approaches for temporal link prediction tasks.

The Graphiti architecture, developed by Zep [3], extends traditional TKG concepts by implementing bi-temporal fact tracking, where facts maintain both valid-time (when the fact was true in reality) and transaction-time (when the fact was recorded in the system). This dual temporal dimension enables sophisticated temporal reasoning capabilities including fact invalidation, temporal pattern detection, and anomaly identification.

### B. Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Current State and Limitations

Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems, pioneered by Lewis et al. [4], combine large language models with external knowledge retrieval mechanisms to enhance factual accuracy and reduce hallucination. However, most RAG implementations focus on static document retrieval without considering temporal dynamics or fact evolution over time.

Recent work by Gao et al. [5] highlighted the limitations of static RAG systems in temporal reasoning tasks, showing that traditional approaches fail to maintain temporal consistency when facts change over time. Petroni et al. [6] demonstrated that language models struggle with temporal knowledge, particularly when dealing with evolving facts and time-sensitive relationships.

Our approach addresses these limitations by integrating temporal knowledge graphs that maintain fact validity periods and enable time-aware retrieval, significantly improving temporal reasoning capabilities compared to static RAG systems.

### C. Financial Document Analysis and Temporal Reasoning

SEC filing analysis presents unique challenges requiring sophisticated temporal reasoning capabilities. Kogan et al. [7] demonstrated that temporal patterns in SEC filings contain significant predictive information for financial analysis. However, traditional approaches rely on manual analysis or simple keyword-based search mechanisms that fail to capture complex temporal relationships.

Recent advances in financial NLP by Araci [8] showed that domain-specific language models improve financial document analysis, but these approaches still lack temporal reasoning capabilities. Our work extends these findings by demonstrating that temporal knowledge graphs provide superior performance for time-sensitive financial analysis tasks.

### D. Agent Frameworks and Tool Integration

The Open Deep Search (ODS) framework represents a significant advancement in agent-based information retrieval systems [9]. However, current implementations lack temporal reasoning capabilities, limiting their effectiveness for time-sensitive analysis tasks.

Recent work on tool-augmented language models by Schick et al. [10] demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating specialized tools with language models. Our research extends this paradigm by integrating temporal knowledge graphs as specialized tools for temporal reasoning within agent frameworks.

## III. Dataset Development and Methodology

### A. Hybrid Dataset Construction

#### 1. Dataset Composition and Rationale

Our evaluation utilizes a carefully constructed hybrid dataset combining synthetic temporal events with real-world SEC filing data. This hybrid approach was chosen for several critical reasons:

**Real-World Validation**: The SEC filing component provides authentic temporal patterns and regulatory compliance data, ensuring our evaluation reflects real-world complexity and temporal dynamics.

**Controlled Evaluation**: The synthetic component enables controlled testing of specific temporal reasoning capabilities, allowing us to isolate and measure particular aspects of temporal intelligence.

**Scalability Assessment**: The hybrid structure allows evaluation across different data scales and temporal complexities, providing insights into system scalability and performance characteristics.

**Temporal Diversity**: Combining synthetic and real data ensures comprehensive coverage of temporal patterns, from regular compliance cycles to irregular event-driven filings.

### B. Dataset Migration: COVID-19 to SEC Filings

#### 1. Initial COVID-19 Dataset Context

Our initial research utilized a COVID-19 temporal dataset containing epidemiological events, policy changes, and healthcare system responses. While this dataset provided valuable insights into temporal reasoning capabilities, it presented several limitations for enterprise applications:

**Domain Specificity**: COVID-19 data, while temporally rich, lacked the regulatory structure and compliance patterns essential for enterprise financial analysis.

**Limited Business Relevance**: Healthcare temporal patterns differ significantly from financial reporting cycles and regulatory compliance requirements.

**Evaluation Constraints**: COVID-19 data provided limited opportunities to evaluate business-critical temporal reasoning capabilities such as compliance monitoring and regulatory pattern detection.

#### 2. Migration to SEC Filing Data

The transition to SEC filing data was motivated by several factors:

**Enterprise Relevance**: SEC filings represent a critical enterprise use case requiring sophisticated temporal reasoning for compliance monitoring and financial analysis.

**Regulatory Structure**: SEC filing requirements provide well-defined temporal patterns and compliance cycles, enabling systematic evaluation of temporal reasoning capabilities.

**Real-World Impact**: SEC filing analysis has direct business applications, making our evaluation results immediately relevant for enterprise deployment.

### B. Temporal Knowledge Graph Integration Architecture

#### 1. TKG Query Recognition System

Our system implements an intelligent temporal query recognition mechanism that automatically identifies when temporal reasoning is required:

**Temporal Indicators Detection**:
- Time-based keywords: "timeline", "pattern", "frequency", "over time", "historical"
- Comparative temporal terms: "compare", "versus", "between", "evolution"
- Anomaly detection terms: "irregular", "unusual", "gaps", "anomalies"
- Pattern analysis terms: "trends", "cycles", "seasonal", "periodic"

**Query Classification Algorithm**:
```
IF query CONTAINS temporal_indicators AND 
   query CONTAINS entity_references AND
   query REQUIRES temporal_reasoning
THEN invoke_temporal_kg_tool()
ELSE use_standard_tools()
```

#### 2. TKG Invocation Prompts

**System Prompt for Enhanced Agent**:
```
You are an expert SEC filing analyst with access to both web search and a temporal knowledge graph.

MANDATORY WORKFLOW:
1. ALWAYS use temporal_kg_search tool FIRST for SEC filing queries
2. Only use web search if temporal_kg_search doesn't provide sufficient information
3. Combine both sources in your final answer

The temporal_kg_search tool provides:
- Real SEC filing data with exact dates
- Company-specific filing patterns and timelines
- Temporal relationships and anomaly detection
- Historical filing frequency analysis

For queries about filing patterns, timelines, comparisons, or anomalies - temporal_kg_search is REQUIRED.
```

**Temporal Query Transformation Examples**:
- Input: "Show me Apple's filing timeline"
- Transformed: "temporal_kg_search: Apple SEC filing chronological sequence with pattern analysis"

- Input: "Compare Microsoft and Apple filing frequencies"
- Transformed: "temporal_kg_search: Microsoft Apple comparative filing frequency temporal analysis"

2. **Template Selection**: Choose appropriate Cypher template based on query type
3. **Parameter Extraction**: Extract company names, date ranges, filing types
4. **Query Construction**: Generate executable Cypher query with temporal constraints
5. **Validation**: Verify query syntax and semantic correctness

**Example Cypher Queries**:

*Simple Retrieval*:
```cypher
MATCH (c:Company {name: 'Apple Inc.'})-[:FILED]->(f:Filing)
WHERE f.type = '10-Q' AND f.filing_date >= date('2024-01-01')
RETURN c.name, f.type, f.filing_date, f.description
ORDER BY f.filing_date DESC
```

*Temporal Pattern Analysis*:
```cypher
MATCH (c:Company)-[:FILED]->(f:Filing)
WHERE f.type = '10-Q'
WITH c, count(f) as filing_count, 
     collect(f.filing_date) as dates
WHERE filing_count > 4
RETURN c.name, filing_count, dates
ORDER BY filing_count DESC
```

*Comparative Analysis*:
```cypher
MATCH (c:Company)-[:FILED]->(f:Filing)
WHERE c.name IN ['Apple Inc.', 'Microsoft Corporation']
  AND f.filing_date >= date('2023-01-01')
WITH c.name as company, f.type as filing_type,
