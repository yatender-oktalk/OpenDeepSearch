# Temporal Knowledge Graph Integration in Open Deep Search Agents: A Quantitative Evaluation

## Abstract

This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of integrating Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKG) into the Open Deep Search (ODS) agent framework for SEC filing analysis. We compare three approaches: baseline web search, GraphRAG with Neo4j, and advanced Temporal Knowledge Graphs using Zep's Graphiti engine. Our evaluation demonstrates significant quantitative improvements, with TKG achieving 770% improvement in temporal intelligence and 9× faster response times compared to baseline approaches. The results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of temporal knowledge graph integration for time-sensitive financial analysis applications.

## I. Introduction

Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have transformed information access and reasoning capabilities, yet they often struggle with temporal knowledge that evolves over time. Traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods lack temporal awareness, making them inadequate for dynamic enterprise environments where historical context is critical.

This research addresses this limitation by integrating temporal knowledge graphs into the ODS agent framework, enabling time-aware memory and temporal reasoning capabilities specifically for SEC filing analysis. Our contributions include:

1. A novel integration of temporal knowledge graphs with open agent frameworks
2. Comprehensive quantitative evaluation across three distinct approaches
3. Validation of temporal reasoning capabilities for financial document analysis
4. Performance benchmarks for temporal intelligence in agent systems

## II. Related Work

### A. Temporal Knowledge Graphs
Temporal Knowledge Graphs extend traditional knowledge graphs by incorporating time-based relationships and fact validity periods. Recent advances in TKG architectures have demonstrated superior performance in temporal reasoning tasks compared to static graph approaches.

### B. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
RAG systems combine large language models with external knowledge retrieval mechanisms. However, most RAG implementations focus on static document retrieval without considering temporal dynamics or fact evolution over time.

### C. Financial Document Analysis
SEC filing analysis requires sophisticated temporal reasoning capabilities to identify patterns, anomalies, and regulatory compliance trends. Traditional approaches rely on manual analysis or simple keyword-based search mechanisms.

## III. Methodology

### A. Experimental Design

We implemented a three-tier evaluation framework comparing distinct approaches for SEC filing analysis:

**Baseline Approach:** Web search integration with Gemini 1.5 Flash for real-time information retrieval without pre-processed data structures.

**GraphRAG Approach:** Neo4j graph database with 25,606 SEC filings, utilizing LLM-generated Cypher queries for structured data retrieval.

**Temporal Knowledge Graph Approach:** Zep Cloud platform with Graphiti engine, featuring 150 representative filings with bi-temporal fact tracking and automatic relationship extraction.

### B. Dataset Specification

Our evaluation utilized a comprehensive SEC filing dataset containing 587 temporal events across 15 major public companies spanning from June 2022 to June 2025. The dataset includes multiple filing types (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, DEF 14A) with validated temporal consistency and entity relationships.

### C. Query Design

We developed two categories of evaluation queries:

**Advanced Temporal Queries (5 queries):** Pattern analysis, timeline reconstruction, comparative analysis, anomaly detection, and seasonal pattern recognition.

**GraphRAG Evaluation Queries (5 queries):** Direct retrieval, temporal filtering, aggregation, company search, and type-based filtering.

### D. Evaluation Metrics

**Temporal Intelligence Score:** Composite metric based on pattern detection, temporal correlation, anomaly detection, predictive analysis, and temporal reasoning capabilities.

**Performance Metrics:** Response time, tool activation rate, precision score, completeness score, and success rate across query categories.

## IV. System Architecture

### A. GraphRAG Implementation

The GraphRAG system utilizes a Neo4j graph database with company and filing nodes connected through temporal relationships. Query processing involves LLM-generated Cypher queries executed against the database, followed by result formatting with temporal context indicators.

**Database Schema:** Company nodes contain organizational metadata (name, ticker, sector), while Filing nodes include temporal properties (type, date, description). Relationships capture filing events with associated timestamps.

**Query Processing Pipeline:** Natural language queries are transformed into Cypher statements through LLM processing, executed against the graph database, and formatted into structured responses with temporal intelligence indicators.

### B. Temporal Knowledge Graph Implementation

The TKG system leverages Zep's Graphiti engine for intelligent temporal reasoning. The architecture supports bi-temporal fact tracking, automatic fact invalidation, and hybrid search combining semantic, temporal, and graph-based methodologies.

**Temporal Fact Processing:** Facts include validity periods with automatic invalidation when contradictory information is detected. The system maintains relationship extraction capabilities for company-filing temporal connections.

**Data Loading Process:** SEC filings are processed through automatic entity extraction, temporal relationship building, and validity period assignment, enabling semantic and temporal search capabilities.

### C. Baseline Implementation

The baseline system utilizes direct web search through the Serper API with LLM processing of search results. This approach represents traditional information retrieval without pre-processed knowledge structures.
