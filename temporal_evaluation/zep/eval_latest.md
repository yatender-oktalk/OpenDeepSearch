# **Comparative Evaluation of Temporal Knowledge Graph Integration in Question Answering Systems: Implementation Quality vs. Architectural Choice**

## **Abstract**

Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) have emerged as a promising approach for enhancing question answering systems with structured temporal reasoning capabilities. However, the practical effectiveness of different TKG implementations remains understudied. This paper presents a comprehensive three-way comparative evaluation of temporal reasoning approaches: dynamic web search (OpenDeepSearch), structured GraphRAG with Neo4j, and advanced bi-temporal TKG (Zep Graphiti) on SEC filing queries. Our evaluation on 25,606 SEC filings across 5 temporal reasoning tasks reveals a clear performance hierarchy: OpenDeepSearch (115.95¬±6.9) > GraphRAG Neo4j (93.67¬±35.8) > Zep TKG (42.05¬±15.5) with statistical significance (F=8.42, p=0.003). **Key finding: GraphRAG achieves 81% of dynamic search performance while providing structured consistency**, and shows 123% improvement over Zep TKG, demonstrating that **implementation quality determines success more than architectural choice**. These results provide practical guidance for enterprise temporal reasoning system design and challenge assumptions about the superiority of complex TKG architectures.

## **1. Introduction**

Temporal reasoning in question answering systems has become increasingly important as users demand precise, time-aware information retrieval. Traditional approaches rely on dynamic web search, while emerging research focuses on Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) for structured temporal representation. However, the practical trade-offs between these approaches remain poorly understood.

This paper addresses the research question: **How do different temporal reasoning implementations compare in real-world performance, and what factors determine their effectiveness?**

We contribute:
1. **First comprehensive three-way evaluation** of temporal reasoning approaches on real-world data
2. **Quantification of performance trade-offs** between dynamic and structured approaches  
3. **Evidence that implementation quality matters more than architectural complexity**
4. **Practical guidance** for enterprise temporal reasoning system design

## **2. Related Work**

### **2.1 Temporal Knowledge Graphs**
TKGs extend traditional KGs with temporal dimensions (Trivedi et al., 2017; Lacroix et al., 2020). Recent work includes bi-temporal reasoning (Zep Graphiti), static temporal graphs (Neo4j-based systems), and dynamic temporal embeddings (Zhang et al., 2024).

### **2.2 Temporal Question Answering**
Temporal QA systems range from rule-based approaches (Verhagen et al., 2007) to neural architectures (Jia et al., 2021). However, most evaluations use synthetic datasets rather than real-world temporal data.

### **2.3 Information Retrieval Evaluation**
Standard IR evaluation follows TREC methodologies (Voorhees & Harman, 2005). Recent work extends these to knowledge graph evaluation (Bordes et al., 2013) and temporal processing (TempEval framework).

**Research Gap:** No comprehensive comparison of practical TKG implementations on real-world temporal reasoning tasks.

- **Clean data schema**: Structured company-filing relationships
- **Optimized queries**: LLM-generated Cypher for precise retrieval
- **Validation pipeline**: Data quality controls and error handling

### **5.2 Performance Trade-offs**

GraphRAG achieves **81% of web search performance** while providing:
- **Structured, consistent outputs**
- **3-10x faster response times**
