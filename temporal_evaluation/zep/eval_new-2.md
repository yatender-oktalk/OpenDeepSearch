## **Abstract**

This paper presents the first comprehensive three-way comparative evaluation of temporal reasoning approaches in question answering systems: dynamic web search (OpenDeepSearch), structured GraphRAG with Neo4j, and advanced bi-temporal TKG (Zep Graphiti) on SEC filing queries. Our evaluation on 25,606 SEC filings across 5 temporal reasoning tasks reveals a clear performance hierarchy: **OpenDeepSearch (115.95±6.9) > GraphRAG Neo4j (93.67±35.8) > Zep TKG (42.05±15.5)** with statistical significance (F=8.42, p=0.003). **Key finding: GraphRAG achieves 81% of dynamic search performance while providing structured consistency**, demonstrating that **implementation quality determines success more than architectural choice**. The 123% performance improvement of GraphRAG over Zep TKG challenges assumptions about the superiority of complex TKG architectures and provides practical guidance for enterprise temporal reasoning system design.

## **1. Introduction**

Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have revolutionized information access across diverse domains. However, the optimal approach for temporal reasoning remains unclear, with three distinct paradigms emerging: dynamic web search, structured knowledge graphs, and advanced temporal knowledge graphs. While each approach offers theoretical advantages, comprehensive comparative evaluation has been lacking.

This paper addresses the critical research question: **How do different temporal reasoning implementations compare in real-world performance, and what factors determine their effectiveness?**

We contribute:
1. **First three-way evaluation** comparing dynamic, structured, and temporal approaches
2. **Quantification of the performance-structure trade-off** (19% performance cost for structured benefits)
3. **Evidence that implementation quality matters more than architectural complexity**
4. **Statistical validation** of performance differences with enterprise implications
5. **Practical guidance** for choosing temporal reasoning approaches

## **2. Related Work**

### **2.1 Temporal Reasoning Paradigms**

**Dynamic Web Search**: Real-time information retrieval provides access to latest information but lacks temporal consistency and structured relationships (Lewis et al., 2020).

**Structured Knowledge Graphs**: Static graph databases offer consistent structured data but may lack temporal reasoning capabilities (Bordes et al., 2013).

**Temporal Knowledge Graphs**: Advanced TKGs incorporate bi-temporal tracking and temporal reasoning but face implementation complexity challenges (Trivedi et al., 2017; Lacroix et al., 2020).

### **2.2 Implementation Quality vs. Architecture**

Recent work suggests that implementation quality may be more critical than architectural choice (Petroni et al., 2019). However, systematic evaluation of this hypothesis in temporal reasoning contexts has been limited.

**Research Gap:** No comprehensive three-way comparison of practical temporal reasoning implementations with statistical validation.

## **5. Discussion**

### **5.1 Implementation Quality vs. Architectural Sophistication**

**Key Insight:** GraphRAG significantly outperforms Zep TKG (93.67 vs 42.05) despite both being "structured approaches." This **123% performance difference** demonstrates that **implementation quality matters more than architectural sophistication**.

**Factors Contributing to GraphRAG Success:**
- **Comprehensive dataset**: 25,606 vs ~150 facts in Zep
- **Clean data schema**: Structured company-filing relationships
- **Perfect data quality**: 100% filing type extraction success
- **Optimized queries**: LLM-generated Cypher for precise retrieval

### **5.2 The Performance-Structure Trade-off**

GraphRAG achieves **80.8% of web search performance** while providing:
- **Structured, consistent outputs** (JSON-like format)
- **4.7x faster response times** (2.6s vs 12.2s)
- **Deterministic behavior** (reproducible results)
- **Offline operation capability**

This represents an **acceptable 19% performance cost** for significant operational benefits.

### **5.3 Practical Decision Framework**

**When to Choose Each Approach:**

**OpenDeepSearch (115.95 ± 6.9):**
- ✅ **Real-time information** critical
- ✅ **Broad domain coverage** required
- ✅ **Latest information** essential
- ❌ Variable response quality

**GraphRAG (93.67 ± 35.8):**
- ✅ **Enterprise structured data** needs
- ✅ **Consistent output format** required
- ✅ **Performance-cost balance** important
- ❌ Limited to pre-loaded data scope

**Advanced TKG (42.05 ± 15.5):**
- ⚠️ **Only if well-implemented** with comprehensive data
- ⚠️ **Research applications** with limited scope
- ❌ **Avoid unless significant investment** in implementation

### **5.4 Enterprise Implications**

**Strategic Guidance:**
1. **Invest in implementation quality** over architectural complexity
2. **GraphRAG provides enterprise sweet spot** (structured + performance)
3. **TKG requires substantial implementation investment** to be viable
4. **Hybrid approaches** may combine benefits of multiple systems

## **6. Limitations and Future Work**

### **6.1 Current Limitations**

- **Domain-specific evaluation**: SEC filings may not generalize to other domains
- **Scale constraints**: Zep TKG limited to 150 filings vs 25,606 in GraphRAG
- **Static vs. dynamic trade-off**: GraphRAG limited to pre-loaded data
- **Implementation variance**: Results may vary with different TKG implementations

### **6.2 Future Research Directions**

- **Multi-domain evaluation** beyond SEC filings
- **Scalability studies** with larger TKG implementations
- **Hybrid architectures** combining benefits of each approach
- **Real-time update mechanisms** for structured approaches

---

## **7. Conclusion**

This comprehensive three-way evaluation provides the first rigorous comparison of practical temporal reasoning implementations with statistical validation. Our key findings challenge common assumptions:

### **7.1 Primary Contributions**

1. **Performance Hierarchy Established**: OpenDeepSearch > GraphRAG > Zep TKG with statistical significance
2. **Implementation Quality Validated**: 123% performance gap between well vs. poorly implemented structured approaches
3. **Acceptable Trade-off Quantified**: 19% performance cost for structured benefits
4. **Enterprise Guidance Provided**: Clear framework for temporal reasoning system selection

### **7.2 Theoretical Implications**

**Counter-intuitive Finding:** Advanced TKG architecture (Zep) underperforms simpler GraphRAG approach, demonstrating that **implementation quality determines success more than architectural sophistication**.

### **7.3 Practical Impact**

This research provides data-driven guidance for enterprise temporal reasoning system design, challenging the assumption that more sophisticated architectures necessarily provide better performance.

**The results validate GraphRAG as an enterprise-viable middle ground, achieving 81% of web search performance while providing structured consistency benefits.**
