# Scientific Report: Temporal Knowledge Graph Evaluation for OpenDeepSearch Agents

## Abstract

This report presents a comprehensive evaluation of temporal knowledge graph systems for OpenDeepSearch agents, focusing on time-aware reasoning capabilities. We compare three distinct approaches: dynamic web search (OpenDeepSearch), structured knowledge graphs (GraphRAG Neo4j), and bi-temporal knowledge graphs (Zep TKG). Our evaluation implements established academic methodologies including TREC Information Retrieval metrics, Knowledge Graph evaluation standards, and TempEval temporal reasoning frameworks. The study reveals significant differences in temporal accuracy, entity recognition, and pattern detection capabilities across systems, with implications for enhancing LLM agent temporal reasoning in enterprise scenarios.

## 1. Introduction

Temporal knowledge graphs represent a critical advancement in LLM agent capabilities, particularly for OpenDeepSearch agents where temporal awareness and chronological reasoning are paramount. Current LLM agents lack reliable temporal awareness - they cannot consistently answer "when did X happen?" or understand chronological context, significantly limiting their effectiveness in enterprise scenarios where historical context matters.

This study evaluates three distinct temporal knowledge graph implementations to assess their effectiveness in enabling time-aware reasoning for OpenDeepSearch agents, addressing the core problem of temporal awareness in AI agent systems.

### 1.1 Research Objectives

- **Temporal Awareness Assessment**: Evaluate the ability of different systems to provide accurate chronological responses for time-sensitive queries
- **Agent Integration Analysis**: Compare how web search, structured KG, and bi-temporal KG approaches enhance OpenDeepSearch agent capabilities
- **Enterprise Scenario Evaluation**: Assess temporal reasoning effectiveness in SEC filing analysis and other time-critical business contexts
- **Methodology Standardization**: Establish evaluation frameworks for temporal knowledge graph systems in LLM agent environments

### 1.2 Core Innovation

The research addresses the fundamental limitation of current LLM agents in temporal reasoning by integrating Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) into OpenDeepSearch agents to enable time-aware reasoning capabilities. This allows agents to answer questions like:
- "What happened to Customer X between 2020-2022?"
- "Show me the timeline of events for Company Y"
- "What was the sequence of interactions before the upgrade?"
- "When did Apple file their 2024 10-Q reports?"

Instead of hallucinating or missing temporal context, enhanced agents can provide accurate, chronological responses with precise historical context.

### 1.3 Evaluation Framework

Our evaluation implements standard IR metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and Hits@K. These metrics provide the foundation for assessing retrieval performance across different system architectures.

Following Bordes et al. (2013), we evaluate knowledge graph systems based on entity extraction accuracy, relationship identification precision, graph structure completeness, and multi-hop reasoning capabilities. This framework ensures comprehensive assessment of graph-based approaches.

The TempEval framework (Verhagen et al., 2007) provides the foundation for temporal reasoning evaluation, including temporal accuracy with fuzzy date matching, temporal pattern detection, and temporal consistency validation. Our implementation extends this framework to include bi-temporal modeling assessment.
