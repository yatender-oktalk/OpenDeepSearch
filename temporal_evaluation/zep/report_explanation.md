## I. Start with the Big Picture (2-3 minutes)

### Project Title & Team
Briefly introduce yourself and the project title. Establish your credibility and the scope of your work.

### The Problem Statement
**Core Challenge**: LLM-based agents struggle with temporal knowledge in dynamic enterprise environments, especially financial analysis (SEC filings).

**Why This Matters**:

### Evaluation Framework (I.3 & II.3)

**Academic Foundation**: "To ensure academic rigor, our evaluation framework is grounded in established literature."

**Established Metrics**:
- **TREC**: Information Retrieval metrics for relevance and precision
- **Bordes et al.**: Knowledge Graph completion and reasoning metrics
- **TempEval**: Temporal reasoning and event ordering metrics

**Zep-Specific Capability Metrics**:
Our novel contribution includes specialized metrics for temporal reasoning:

- Cohen's d for effect size analysis
- Confidence intervals for reliability assessment

### Query Design (III.B.2)

We designed two categories of queries to comprehensively evaluate system capabilities:

#### General SEC Filing Queries
**Purpose**: Broad comparison across all systems
**Examples**: 
- "When did Apple file their 10-Q for Q3 2023?"
- "How many 10-K filings did Meta submit in 2024?"

#### Advanced Temporal Queries
**Purpose**: Specifically test TKG's unique capabilities
**Examples**:
- "Show me the temporal validity of Apple's filing patterns"
- "Detect anomalies in filing schedules across tech companies"
- "Trace the evolution of filing behavior after regulatory changes"

## III. Key Results & Analysis: What We Found (7-10 minutes)

### Overall Performance Comparison (Table II)

**General Query Performance**:
"For general SEC filing queries, **GraphRAG (90.52%)** clearly outperformed both **Baseline (74.37%)** and **TKG (40.15%)**."

**Why GraphRAG Excels**:
- Structured data is highly effective for direct factual retrieval
- Pre-processed information eliminates search overhead
- Optimized for specific domain queries

**TKG's Speed Advantage**:
"However, the **TKG demonstrated a significant speed advantage**, being **9.8x faster than Baseline** (1.12s vs 12.52s) and notably faster than GraphRAG (2.75s)."

**Performance Trade-offs**:
- GraphRAG: High accuracy, slower speed
- TKG: Lower accuracy on general queries, but much faster
- Baseline: Moderate accuracy, slowest speed

### TKG's Specialized Strengths (Table IV & TKG Capability Profile)

**"This is where our TKG truly shines."**

**Overall Temporal Intelligence**: TKG achieved an overall temporal intelligence score of **77.08%**.

**Specialized Success**: "It demonstrated **100% success on specific temporal reasoning queries** (e.g., multi-hop reasoning, fact invalidation, bi-temporal modeling)."

**Key Capabilities Demonstrated**:
- **Bi-temporal Modeling**: Perfect tracking of information validity periods
- **Multi-hop Reasoning**: Complex temporal relationship inference
- **Fact Invalidation**: Understanding when information becomes outdated
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying temporal trends and anomalies

**Areas for Improvement**:
- **Pattern Detection**: Currently at 12.5% enhanced performance
- **Output Parsimony**: Sometimes verbose responses affect IR metrics
- **Domain Specificity**: Optimized for financial data

### Statistical Significance Analysis (Figure 3)

**Rigorous Validation**: "We performed rigorous statistical analysis to validate our findings."

**Key Statistical Results**:
- **GraphRAG vs TKG**: Statistically significant difference (p=0.0231) with large effect size (Cohen's d = 1.7724)
- **OpenDeepSearch vs GraphRAG**: No statistically significant difference for general queries
- **Practical Significance**: Effect sizes indicate meaningful real-world impact

**Interpretation**:
- GraphRAG's superior performance for general retrieval is statistically validated
- TKG's specialized capabilities show different strengths
- Both approaches have valid use cases

### Qualitative Analysis (Table III)

**Unique TKG Outputs**: Pick 1-2 compelling examples to illustrate TKG's unique capabilities:

**Example 1 - Temporal Validity**:
```
TKG Output: "Apple's 10-Q filing was valid from 2023-11-02 to 2024-02-01"
Baseline: "Apple filed their 10-Q on November 2, 2023"
```

**Example 2 - Pattern Analysis**:
```
TKG Output: "Detected seasonal pattern: Tech companies file 10-Ks 
consistently in late February, with 85% filing between Feb 20-28"
Baseline: "Various filing dates found"
```

**Qualitative Superiority**: These examples show TKG's ability to provide temporal depth that baseline systems cannot match.

## Anticipate Questions

### Technical Questions

#### "Why is TKG's overall score lower if it's so good?"
**Response**: "The lower score reflects TKG's specialized nature. It's optimized for temporal reasoning rather than general information retrieval. The verbose output, while rich in temporal context, doesn't always align with traditional IR metrics. However, on its intended use case - temporal reasoning - it achieves 100% success."

#### "How does the TKG actually reason about time?"
**Response**: "The TKG uses bi-temporal tracking, maintaining two timestamps for each fact: when it was created and when it becomes invalid. It can perform multi-hop reasoning across temporal relationships, detect patterns in time-series data, and understand when information becomes outdated. This enables complex temporal queries that other systems cannot handle."

### Implementation Questions

#### "What's the biggest challenge you faced?"
**Response**: "The biggest challenges were:
1. **Parsing Complex Outputs**: Zep's rich temporal responses required sophisticated parsing
2. **Data Integration**: Ensuring temporal consistency across multiple data sources
3. **Evaluation Design**: Creating metrics that capture temporal reasoning capabilities
4. **System Coordination**: Managing multiple AI systems with different strengths"

#### "What's the next immediate step for this project?"
**Response**: "The immediate next steps are:
1. **Scale the Dataset**: Expand to more companies and longer time periods
2. **Optimize Output**: Reduce verbosity while maintaining temporal richness
3. **Real-time Integration**: Connect to live SEC filing feeds
4. **Cross-domain Validation**: Test on non-financial temporal data"

### Academic Questions

#### "How does this compare to existing temporal reasoning systems?"
**Response**: "Our approach is unique in integrating temporal reasoning directly into an agent framework. While there are standalone temporal reasoning systems, our contribution is the seamless integration that allows analysts to access temporal capabilities through familiar interfaces."

#### "What are the broader implications for AI research?"
**Response**: "This work advances AI's ability to reason about time, which is crucial for many real-world applications. It demonstrates how specialized reasoning capabilities can be integrated into general-purpose AI systems, opening new possibilities for time-sensitive AI applications."
