His Bohr model of the atom incorporated quantum theory and explained how electrons could have stable orbits.  4. **Johannes Stark (1919)** - Stark was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the Doppler effect in canal rays and the splitting of spectral lines in electric fields (the Stark effect), both phenomena that provided insights into atomic structure and quantum mechanics.  5. **James Franck and Gustav Hertz (1925)** - Franck and Hertz's Nobel Prize was awarded for their experiments on electron impacts in atoms, which confirmed quantum energy levels within atoms.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Stark,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Franck,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Hertz,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Physics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_model,,Numerical reasoning | Multiple constraints | Post processing,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Stark', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Franck', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Hertz', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Physics', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_model']"
